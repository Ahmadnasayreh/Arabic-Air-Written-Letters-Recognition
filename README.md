	Hybrid Model Development: Created a hybrid model combining deep learning (VGG16, VGG19, SqueezeNet) with machine learning (NN, RF, KNN, SVM), achieving 88% accuracy using VGG16 and NN.
	Data Preprocessing: Implemented preprocessing techniques like image alignment, noise reduction, and normalization to improve data quality.
	Optimization Techniques: Applied grid and random search algorithms to fine-tune model parameters for better recognition outcomes.
	Dataset Utilization: Trained and evaluated models using the diverse AHAWP dataset.
	Air Writing Tools: Developed an air writing system using hand gestures detected by a webcam and Google’s Mediapipe library, converting gestures into letter images for recognition.
